## What does the "Add" button in translation popup do?
Right now, nothing. In future it will add words to [Repeatio Extension](https://github.com/qucumbah/repeatio-extension)'s list of words to be learned.

## Which book formats are supported?
FB2, EPUB and PDF, you can use the translation feature in either (if the book quality allows it).

## Where can I try it?
You can find repeatio [here](https://qucumbah.github.io/repeatio-pwa/)

## This is a completely new section
It's been added to check that azure task "Deploy" doesn't start on pull request
